Me and Alexandre Calado had the opportunity to teach a small course on medical image segmentation at a small student conference organised by the Núcleo de Estudantes do Departamento de Física at Universidade de Coimbra.

It was a great opportunity to brush up on what we know and how we can best communicate it. Given that it was supposed to be a hands-on workshop, I thought that a small Kaggle notebook could be a great opportunity of getting everyone's hands dirty with a club classic - the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. So I coded a small tutorial on [medical image segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/josegcpa/medical-decathlon-starter).
