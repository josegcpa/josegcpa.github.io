In [JEST](http://jest.pt/), a junior enterprise providing pedagogical services in data-science, I had the opportunity to teach programming at a beginner level, with particular focus on `R` and `Python`. Within `Python`, apart from focusing on the basic aspect of it, I also had the opportunity to speak about more modern packages for interactive data visualization, such as `plotly`.
