In the [2018 EMBL Predoc Course](https://www.embl.de/predoccourse/2018/modules/basic_teaching/index.html) and with Julian Hennies, I talked about feature extraction in images and how this can be applied to segmentation problems. We also discussed, more generically, how machine-learning can be applied to some other biology problems.
