DICOM - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine - is the _de facto_ standard for medical and other data formats. Anything from a waveform to a clinical report can be stored as a DICOM file, so it is a fairly powerful format.

DICOM acts as a standard - there are a number of tags which are used to store metadata. These tags have predictable names described by [well-documented documentation](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods).
