In 2024, I participated as faculty in the "How to develop a radiomics signature" course organised for the [European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology](https://esgar.org/). Here, I gave a short presentation on machine-learning model development and tuning, as well as two practical programming sessions: one on radiomic feature extraction and the other on model development and (fine-)tuning. Both are [freely available](https://github.com/CCIG-Champalimaud/waw-tace-radiomics).
