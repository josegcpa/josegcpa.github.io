### October 2017 - present: PhD student
European Bioinformatics Institute<br>
*Principal investigators: Moritz Gerstung and George S. Vassiliou*<br>
**Description:** Leveraging modern computer vision (with a particular focus on deep learning) to understand morphological differences in blood cells, with a focus on haematological cancers;<br>
Using longitudinal sequencing data and statistical modelling to capture the dynamics of somatic mutation evolution in individuals with clonal haematopoiesis
