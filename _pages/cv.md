* Non-scientific publications
    * [BAME and COVID-19](https://www.scientistsforlabour.org.uk/post/bame-and-covid-19), Scientists for Labour (2020) - a detailed assessment of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on individuals with a BAME background in the UK

Skills
======
* Programming 
  * *I have been programming actively for 4 years, with a quite large focus on machine learning, statistics and data science
  * Relevant languages
    * `Python` - advanced user
    * `R` - advanced user
    * `bash` - regular user
    * `C++` - beginner, currently learning
  * Deep learning (DL)
    * *A considerable part of my current work focuses on developing, implementing and using deep learning tools for classification/segmentation*
    * Relevant packages: `tensorflow` (`Python`), `pytorch` (`Python`)
  * Machine learning (ML)
    * Relevant packages: `scikit-learn` (`Python`), `caret` (`R`) 
  * Computer vision (CV)
    * Relevant packages: `opencv`, `scikit-image` (`Python`)

* Statistical analysis and data science
  * Application of both frequentist and Bayesian methods for inferential and predictive statistics
  * Development of approaches to disentangle the effects of different factors in specific problems, namely modelling longitudinal deep and targetted sequencing data
  * Supervised and unsupervised machine learning, with a particular focus on the former for the classification of hot-spots in protein-protein interfaces and haematologic disorders using whole blood slide imaging data
  * Development of a framework for multiple instance and vocabulary learning approach to create a "vocabulary of cells" for the classification of haematologic disorders

* Data visualisation
  * I work mainly with `ggplot2` and have also worked with `plotly` in `R`, mostly using these for scientific figure design
  * Very basic `d3.js` knowledge

* Web platform design and implementation
  * I have developed a few platforms (such as this website) and other projects such as:
    * A platform dedicated to poll data visualisation, education and interpretation ([here](https://zegui7.shinyapps.io/B-A-BA-Sondagens/) - this is available only in Portuguese)
    * Early work on a [DxR-G-protein/Arrestin interaction visualiser](http://www.moreiralab.com/resources/dxr/) that was done for a [publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00371)

Service, collaboration and leadership
======
* Co-founder of JEST, a junior enterprise focused on providing data science training and services (2016)
* Co-director of programming and radio broadcaster in Radio Universidade de Coimbra, a student-ran radio dedicated to teaching radio broadcasting to the general community, where I helped coordinating the department that is responsible for the musical and entertainment content (2016-2017)
* Stage director and manager of Palco RUC, an alternative music festival. In this role I contacted several tens of artists and coordinated their arrivals and departures, coordinated a team of chaperones that looked out for the performers, and planned/arranged whatever was required for each performance (2016)
* Integrated several teams in student unions, where I helped reformulate the curriculum for the Biochemistry BSc. in the University of Coimbra as a student representative in several meetings with professors and degree coordinatores and organised activities in the context of ecological and civil service sensibilisation (2013-2015)

Other skills
=====
* Science communication, with regular contributions to [RNA Mensageiro](https://mrnauc.wordpress.com/), an annual biochemistry student and alumni magazine
* Musical producer and member of a musical production collective, Ciga239, focused on artists with links to Coimbra
