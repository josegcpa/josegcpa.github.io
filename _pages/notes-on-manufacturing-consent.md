*Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky*

**Notes by Jos√© Guilherme de Almeida**

## 1 Propaganda model

In this chapter, Herman and Chomsky define the propaganda model which will sustain the rest of the book. The model itself in practical terms a series of filters that affect the "true reporting" that we would get in their absence. The 5 filters are summarised as subheadings in this chapter and below as 5 points:

1. **Size, ownership and profit orientation** - here liberalism really plays a decisive role in creating a media that is focused on profitability by necessity (shareholders, Reaganomics, you know the drill). While initially this does not have to be terrible (if we disregard most ethical problems with the system), by focusing on profits you create a system were the metric stops being quality of media (good metric) and starts being the amount of money generated from said media (bad metric - if quality is to be previliged, that is). This ultimately leads to some level of regularised monopolization (this is (was?) achieved by capping the number of TV channels, radio stations and newspaper that a single enterprise can own). Herman and Chomsky present some very nice tables that summarise:
	1. The very small number of entities owning most major media outlets - most of which dedicating their activities to more than one branch of media (TV/radio/newspapers)
	2. The tight grip that the owners/families have on the company with many very few/single majority stockholders
	3. The promiscuity between these outlets and the government through the ownership of/participation as persons with significant power in major media outlets by people who are/were members of the government
	* Interestingly, in Britain, the "free market" and the state's compliance with its existence managed to regulate (see: stop) the existence of labour-leaning/union-supporting major publications (something that the state had previously tried) by creating a system were not only profitability but also the lack of scrupulousness was heavily impactful in the success of media
2. **Advertisement** - Herman and Chomsky argue that a crucial loss of power and leverage for a lot of media institutions happened when advertisement became a necessity to sustain the business model of journalism. More concretely, corporations hoping to advertise in newspaper would intuitively advertise in media outlets which catered to wealthier subsects of the population - this is inquestionable fertile ground to exclude outlets which catered mostly/exclusively to the working class. This also led to media outlets taking a pro-corporation stance to secure the easy influx of advertisement money. Ultimately, this leads to media outlets which are designed to appease corporations/richer strata of the population and leave the disenfranchised without a legitimate and widespread news outlet
	* Here they provide another example with the UK (go figure) where the introduction of media advertisement in the 60s caused Labour-leaning newspapers to become financially unsustainable
	* It is important to notice that advertisement did not enable the production of newspieces from a logistical or technical perspective. The advertisement was however a necessity to decrease the retail price of the newspaper, increasing its accessability. This, combined with the rest of this point, led to newspapers which catered to wealthier subsects of the population to become cheaper, while those catering to the poorer subsects got stuck with the same prices
