# Research

PhD student under [Moritz Gerstung's Computational Cancer Biology group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/gerstung) and George Vassiliou, using data science to better understand haematological cancers. Currently using machine learning and deep learning to look at images of your blood. Currently invested in weird hobbies ranging from musical production to owning colourful socks.

Previously and during my MsC. thesis, I worked in [Irina Moreira's Data-Driven Molecular Design group](http://www.moreiralab.com), focusing on applying machine-learning techniques to predict and understand protein-protein interactions at a structural level.

# Side projects

Stuff I develop on my free time. Mostly music and programming, sometimes a bit of both combined.

* [Z G A](files/zga.md) - my "artistic" (if you can call it that) moniker. I do mostly electronic with no particular focus on subgenre, but I mostly do IDM (hate the term), industrial and/or hip-hop. I will soon be doing some releases, both solo and featuring colaborations (with DEL and SPASM). Follow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ZGAZGAZGA/) to be the first to know when they are released
