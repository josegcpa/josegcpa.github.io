# Bio

I currently am a post-doc with the [Computational Clinical Imaging Group](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/papanikolaou) at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, working on developing novel diagnostic tools for prostate cancer diagnosis using mpMRI. Previously, I did my PhD on the evolution and morphology of blood cells at the EMBL-EBI with [Moritz Gerstung](https://www.dkfz.de/en/kuenstliche-intelligenz-in-der-onkologie/index.php) and [George Vassiliou](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/vassiliou), and my Master's thesis on protein binding prediction with [Irina Moreira's Data-Driven Molecular Design group](http://www.moreiralab.com).

# Research

I currently work on developing deep-learning models that can aid in better diagnostic tools for prostate cancer using mpMRI.
