* I am a Portuguese PhD researcher living in a world with little support for accents. I am interested (professionally) in deep learning and quantitative bioimaging and (non-professionally) in music production, contemporary art, reading, colourful socks and eggs.

* I currently work/study under [Moritz Gerstung](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/gerstung) and [George Vassiliou](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/vassiliou-george-s), using data science/computer vision to better understand haematological cancers. Currently using machine learning and deep learning to look at images of blood and understand relevant morphological differences

* Previously and during my MsC. thesis, I worked in [Irina Moreira's Data-Driven Molecular Design group](http://www.moreiralab.com), focusing on applying machine-learning techniques to predict and understand protein-protein interactions at a structural level.

* I am also a music producer as [Z G A](files/zga.md). I do mostly electronic with no particular focus on subgenre, but I mostly do IDM (hate the term), industrial and/or hip-hop. I will soon be doing some releases, both solo and featuring colaborations (with DEL and SPASM). Follow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ZGAZGAZGA/) to be the first to know when they are released
