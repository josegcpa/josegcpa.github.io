Hi! 👋 I am a data scientist/ML engineer doing research and development on clinical AI. Now, I am working on developing computational tools for medical image analysis with the [Computational Clinical Imaging Group](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/papanikolaou) using artificial intelligence. 

Previously:

- I did a PhD on blood cell evolution and morphology at EMBL-EBI/Cambridge University with [Moritz Gerstung](https://www.dkfz.de/en/artificial-intelligence-in-oncology) and [George Vassiliou](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/vassiliou)
- I did a Master's thesis on protein binding prediction with [Irina Moreira](http://www.moreiralab.com)
