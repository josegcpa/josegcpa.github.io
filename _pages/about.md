# Bio

I am currently wrapping up my PhD at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) as an EMBL PhD fellow. I am jointly supervised by [Moritz Gerstung](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/gerstung) and [George Vassiliou](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/vassiliou-george-s). Previously, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and a Master's degree in Cell and Molecular Biology with honours in the University of Coimbra. In my Master's thesis I worked with in [Irina Moreira's Data-Driven Molecular Design group](http://www.moreiralab.com).

# Research

I currently work on computational oncobiology with a heavy focus on haematological cancers. My PhD project is divided into two distinct avenues:

1. The study and exploration of the morphological determinants of myelodysplastic syndromes in whole blood slides through the use of computer vision, particularly machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches
2. The comprehensive assessment of clonal dynamics in clonal haematopoiesis through the use of longitudinal targetted sequencing and robust statistical methods such as MCMC

Previously, during my MSc, my work focused on approaches based on machine-learning to predict important residues in protein-protein interfaces.
