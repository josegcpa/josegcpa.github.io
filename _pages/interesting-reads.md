## Interviews/conversations

* [Conversation between Foucault and Derrida](https://libcom.org/library/intellectuals-power-a-conversation-between-michel-foucault-and-gilles-deleuze)

    * Here, they discuss the nature of power (as one would expect) and the role of theory as praxis in modern society. Indeed, they argue that modern intellectuals no longer serve to act as the voice of the masses because the (knowing) masses are well informed and know as much about the world surrounding them as the intellectual; instead the intellectual has to focus on the structure that exists surrounding speech, society, culture, etc. and dismantle and expose it to the masses. As such, since this process of deconstruction is itself practice, theory is by analogy praxis
    * They also discuss how speaking for others who have their own voices is indignified - the key issue is to give voice to those who are voiceless, not to act as a replacement for their voices
    * In the end, the discussion gravitates towards what was its initial point - why the difference between siding with the proletariat in class struggle and fighting against power is important (power is universal, whereas class struggle exists as a more specific relatinship). This is also important because framing this struggle as a fight against power and its structures also allows for intersectionality to have a place under the same revolutionary discourse
    
* [Derrida interviewing Ornette Coleman](http://www.ubu.com/papers/Derrida-Interviews-Coleman_1997.pdf)

    * Here, Derrida has a very pleasant talk with Ornette Coleman. They talk about Coleman's past as a black saxophone player from the South witnessing and experiencing violence while developing his own musical style and concept after being ostracized. They also dedicate some time to talk about Coleman's process in writing and playing music for and with other people, as well as how concepts such as globalization are flawed because they always assume a Westernised version of it

* [Kodwo Eshun- Motion Capture](http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_motion.htm?LMCL=VcqAt4)

   * Super cool text by Eshun where he goes from black sci-fi and black music to discussing a book he will write on scratchedelia as science, devoided of the biographical/social/political implications. By talking about this possibility he ends up spilling the beans on a bunch of what the book would cover and goes into his own vision on scratch - a kind of motion capture, where you temporarily lift the human element from the music and give it back shortly after creating a textural rather than rhythmic effect, a completely new type of musical instrument and science. He goes on to discuss the usage of samples in music as this short moment (samplers were not very capable in the late 90s) that helps create synaesthesic experiences by overflowing the hearing apparatus and creating this omnisensorial experience. I cannot really summarise this without saying everything, he talks about A LOT of different topics so reading it is really the way to go
