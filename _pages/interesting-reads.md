## Interviews/conversations

* [Conversation between Foucault and Derrida](https://libcom.org/library/intellectuals-power-a-conversation-between-michel-foucault-and-gilles-deleuze)

    * Here, they discuss the nature of power (as one would expect) and the role of theory as praxis in modern society. Indeed, they argue that modern intellectuals no longer serve to act as the voice of the masses because the (knowing) masses are well informed and know as much about the world surrounding them as the intellectual; instead the intellectual has to focus on the structure that exists surrounding speech, society, culture, etc. and dismantle and expose it to the masses. As such, since this process of deconstruction is itself practice, theory is by analogy praxis
    * They also discuss how speaking for others who have their own voices is indignified - the key issue is to give voice to those who are voiceless, not to act as a replacement for their voices
    * In the end, the discussion gravitates towards what was its initial point - why the difference between siding with the proletariat in class struggle and fighting against power is important (power is universal, whereas class struggle exists as a more specific relatinship). This is also important because framing this struggle as a fight against power and its structures also allows for intersectionality to have a place under the same revolutionary discourse
    
* [Derrida interviewing Ornette Coleman](http://www.ubu.com/papers/Derrida-Interviews-Coleman_1997.pdf)

    * Here, Derrida has a very pleasant talk with Ornette Coleman. They talk about Coleman's past as a black saxophone player from the South witnessing and experiencing violence while developing his own musical style and concept after being ostracized. They also dedicate some time to talk about Coleman's process in writing and playing music for and with other people, as well as how concepts such as globalization are flawed because they always assume a Westernised version of it
    
* [On alienation, the Situationists and everyday revolution - Houssine Alloul interviews Raoul Vaneigem](https://roarmag.org/essays/on-alienation-the-situationists-and-everyday-revolution/)

    * In this short but comprehensive interview to legendary Situationist Raoul Vaneigem, topics as varied as the modern partisan left and its decay into bureaucratic and clientelic modes of operation that eroded working-class conscience, contemporary revolutionary movements (particularly the *Gilet-Jaunes*) and its relation to previous movements (the 1968 ocupy movement), Belgium's own colonial legacy and how it is currently facing it alongside extremist right-wing movements, and even the Situationist International's own intellectualism and how its utility to the masses became questionable by creating an exclusivist environment within its own ranks
    
* [Tim Burrows in conversation with Mark Fisher and Sam Berkson - ‘We Have To Invent The Future’: An Unseen Interview With Mark Fisher](https://thequietus.com/articles/21616-mark-fisher-interview-capitalist-realism-sam-berkson)

   * This is a pretty nice interview Fisher did for The Quietus where him, Sam Berkson and to some extent Tim Burrows discuss the conundrum that public space became as a concept. What they outline as public space - a space that, while congregating many people does not lead to social interaction or makes it even harder (it is a tad bit similar to Augé's concept of non-place). But the public space here is not a place where private life does not happen - rather, it is a place where private life happens publicly, in front of everyone, a private life that we show publicly without being forced but against our will, contrasting with what social media became (a public space of curated private life where celebrity is encouraged). Fisher and Berkson focus on public spaces for travelling (i.e. trains, the tube) because of the latter's latest publication - a book of poems on travelling - and tackle some really interesting problems concerning technology and mass advertisement in the context of hyper-liberalism. Particularly, they mention how easily capitalist society exhausts individuals to facilitate their non-participation in the more public aspect of public spaces by creating situations where, to ignore the mass advertising that surrounds them in the simplest way possible, the individual will draw their attention to their phone or to the consumption of easy media (gossip magazines, trash newspapers).  

## Articles and essays

* [Kodwo Eshun - Motion Capture](http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_motion.htm?LMCL=VcqAt4)

   * Super cool text by Eshun where he goes from black sci-fi and black music to discussing a book he will write on scratchedelia as science, devoided of the biographical/social/political implications. By talking about this possibility he ends up spilling the beans on a bunch of what the book would cover and goes into his own vision on scratch - a kind of motion capture, where you temporarily lift the human element from the music and give it back shortly after creating a textural rather than rhythmic effect, a completely new type of musical instrument and science. He goes on to discuss the usage of samples in music as this short moment (samplers were not very capable in the late 90s) that helps create synaesthesic experiences by overflowing the hearing apparatus and creating this omnisensorial experience. I cannot really summarise this without saying everything, he talks about A LOT of different topics so reading it is really the way to go

* [Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin - Anarchist vs. Marxist-Leninist Thought on the Organization of Society
](https://libcom.org/library/anarchist-vs--leninist-lorenzo-ervin)

   * Very nice essay explicating the concrete differences between Marxist-Leninism and anarcho-communism. Lorenzo does a tremendously good work at really demystifying the false notions of anarchism as purely chaotic and as a perverse reading of Bakunin, and introduces its proper configuration given an anarco-syndicalist setting. It also bashes Lenin's vanguardism for what it was: a cruel step in a slow process to an idealised world which ended up as being the final version of what is commonly perceived as communism - a tiranny of the Bolsheviks over the working class portrayed as a dictatorship of the proletariat. Obviously Lorenzo's text does not stand as a criticism of what vanguardism achieved socially in several different places - rather, it critically analyses claims about the nature of this "dictatorship of the proletariat" in order to expose it as a farce covering the brutal vanguardist authoritarianism  
   
* [Antoine d’Agata and Mehdi Belhaj Kacem - The Geometry of Emptiness: A Journey Through France’s ‘Diagonale du Vide’
](https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/society/antoine-dagata-the-geometry-of-emptiness-a-journey-through-frances-diagonale-du-vide/)

   * A psychogeographical and photographical essay of the France that birthed the _gilets jaunes_. Any comment I can offer on this is bound to be short of the intensity and bleakness which are here captured, so I leave you with a quote: 
   > "For me, the journey’s highlight was the gigantic abandoned sanatorium: I could hear the voices of the thousands of mad people who had lived in this place. Madness is nothing more than a political fact. They want us to believe that one is born mad when actually, one becomes mad. I dream of an organisation that would make madness the central part of its discourse. There is no other madness than the current organisation of society. Our leaders do not seem to want to cure it. The rags of the Capital wearing their yellow vests come to groan at the ears of those robots, but they do not hear anything. Hearing is a prerogative of life, which has deserted this France, which we are crossing like ghosts ourselves. The coming and going of ghosts, the living dead of society."
   
* [Robin Mackay and Mark Fisher - Pomophobia](http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_pomo.htm?LMCL=u4LXgz&LMCL=RhSSsj)

   * One the better known and always contemporary essays from the [CCRU](http://www.ccru.net). In summary (a summary which will do no justice to the text), the text discusses the condition where literally everything is repurposed from previous iterations (for example, the rebelious feelings that Nirvana/Kurt Cobain espouses are nothing but revamped dialectis - as the authors paraphrase: "Smells Like Hegelian Spirit"). This leads to the juxtaposition of novelty and nostalgia, rendering all new things both obsolete and exciting, creating the mental landscape that Mark Fisher so accurately describes in "Capitalist Realism": whatever exists now is an inevitable product of whatever was before. Post-modernism recreated boredom as intense hyperexposition to all stimuli, thus defeating the imagination that would anticipate the creation of a plan for the future. (I don't necessarily with this next point but) "Pomophobia" also criticises the branches of academia dealing with and dicussing this state of hopelessness due to their excessive care for formalisms and protocols and bureaucracies, which excessively delay the creation of novel methodologies, approaches and solutions.

## Reviews

* [Greg Tate - Yo Hermeneutics!: Henry Louis Gates, Houston Baker, and David Toop](https://monoskop.org/images/a/a3/Tate_Greg_1992_Yo_Hermeneutics_Henry_Louis_Gates_Houston_Baker_David_Toop.pdf)

   * The comprehensive 1985 review by Greg Tate on Henry Louis Gates's *Black Literature and Literary Theory*, where he contextualises the book and addresses its strong points of presenting essays that better formalise black literature from a critical theory perspective - Tate considers this language a necessary element in allowing black literary theory to permeate the ivory tower academic world, but he also admits that it leads to the theory drifting away from the real world. _Yo Hermeneutics!_ also addresses to a big extent and in a moderately explanatory fashion the concept of "signifyin'", an exploration of the gap between denotative and significative typical in African-American culture which often relies on the conotative meaning of words, requiring often both cultural and semantic contextual knowledege. Tate, also importantly, places BLALT in context with other writings by Houston Baker, which render a static appreciation of black culture - this leads to ignoring a lot of the more futuristic movement happening at the time, mostly associated with hip hop culture, opposing it to what David Toop had already done with "Rap Attack" and other previous writings.
