### [Z G A - TWSTBARA](https://z-g-a.bandcamp.com/album/twstbara)

### [Z G A - Directrizes e Métodos de Transcendência](https://z-g-a.bandcamp.com/album/directrizes-e-m-todos-de-transcend-ncia)

THE album I released with DEL. Probably the record I enjoyed working on the most.

## Released somewhere else

### [Z G A - Garden](https://emerge.bandcamp.com/album/garden)

It is either an experimental album which follows very pronounced dance music canons or a dance music album which follows some experimental music canons. Conceptualized between the idea of a mass grave as a garden.

Released through [attenuation circuit](https://emerge.bandcamp.com/). Available across streaming platforms. A/V experience will be available as soon as I dedicate myself to it a bit more seriously.

### [Z G A - BODYBODYBODYSOULSOULSOUL](https://ihavenever.bandcamp.com/album/bodybodybodysoulsoulsoul)

Electronic dance music album set on the duality between body as visceral and mind as esoteric.
