## Interviews/conversations

* [Conversation between Foucault and Derrida](https://libcom.org/library/intellectuals-power-a-conversation-between-michel-foucault-and-gilles-deleuze)
    * Here, they discuss the nature of power (as one would expect) and the role of theory as praxis in modern society. Indeed, they argue that modern intellectuals no longer serve to act as the voice of the masses because the (knowing) masses are well informed and know as much about the world surrounding them as the intellectual; instead the intellectual has to focus on the structure that exists surrounding speech, society, culture, etc. and dismantle and expose it to the masses. As such, since this process of deconstruction is itself practice, theory is by analogy praxis
    
* [Derrida interviewing Ornette Coleman](http://www.ubu.com/papers/Derrida-Interviews-Coleman_1997.pdf)
    * Here, Derrida has a very pleasant talk with Ornette Coleman. They talk about Coleman's past as a black saxophone player from the South witnessing and experiencing violence while developing his own musical style and concept after being ostracized. They also dedicate some time to talk about Coleman's process in writing and playing music for and with other people, as well as how concepts such as globalization are flawed because they always assume a Westernised version of it
