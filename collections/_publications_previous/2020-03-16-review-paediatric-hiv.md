## Abstract

Paediatric Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a life-threatening and infectious disease in which the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is mainly transmitted through Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) during pregnancy, labour and delivery, or breastfeeding. This review provides an overview of the distinct therapeutic alternatives to abolish the systemic viral replication in paediatric HIV-1 infection. Numerous classes of antiretroviral agents have emerged as therapeutic tools for downregulation of different steps in the HIV replication process. These classes encompass Non-Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs), Nucleoside/Nucleotide Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs/NtRTIs), INtegrase Inhibitors (INIs), Protease Inhibitors (PIs), and Entry Inhibitors (EIs). Co-administration of certain antiretroviral drugs with Pharmacokinetic Enhancers (PEs) may boost the effectiveness of the primary therapeutic agent. The combination of multiple antiretroviral drug regimens (Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy - HAART) is currently the standard therapeutic approach for HIV infection. So far, the use of HAART offers the best opportunity for prolonged and maximal viral suppression, and preservation of the immune system upon HIV infection. Still, the frequent administration of high doses of multiple drugs, their inefficient ability to reach the viral reservoirs in adequate doses, the development of drug resistance and the lack of patient compliance compromise the complete HIV elimination. The development of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems may enable targeted delivery of antiretroviral agents to inaccessible viral reservoir sites at therapeutic concentrations. In addition, the application of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) approaches has provided valuable tools for the development of anti-HIV drug candidates with favourable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties.
