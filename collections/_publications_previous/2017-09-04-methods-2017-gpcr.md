## Abstract 

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ubiquitously expressed transmembrane proteins associated with a wide range of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson, schizophrenia, and also implicated in in several abnormal heart conditions. As such, this family of receptors is regarded as excellent drug targets. However, due to the high number of intracellular signaling partners, these receptors have a complex interaction networks and it becomes challenging to modulate their function.

Experimentally determined structures give detailed information on the salient structural properties of these signaling complexes but they are far away from providing mechanistic insights into the underlying process. This chapter presents some of the computational tools, namely molecular dynamics, molecular docking, and molecular modeling and related analyses methods that have been used to complement experimental findings.
