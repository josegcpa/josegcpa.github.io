In the [2019 EMBL Lautenschlager Summer School](https://www.embl.de/training/undergraduates/summer_school/index.html), I talked about how to use random forests in an image segmentation context, covering at an introductory levels some aspects of image preprocessing, feature extraction (with some focus on gradient calculation) and the internal mechanics of random forests. During this time, I also aided in practical classes which focused on implementing a pipeline to analyse the growth of *Nematostella*.
