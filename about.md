# Research

I am currently [a PhD student doing science](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4u2Ht8AAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Moritz Gerstung's Computational Cancer Biology group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/gerstung) at the [European Bioinformatics Group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk). My project focuses on understanding how blood images can be associated with clinical and genetic traits using (among other things) deep learning.

Previously and during my MsC. thesis, I worked in [Irina Moreira's Data-Driven Molecular Design group](http://www.moreiralab.com), focusing on applying machine-learning techniques to predict and understand protein-protein interactions at a structural level.

# Side projects

Stuff I develop on my free time. Mostly music and programming, sometimes a bit of both combined.

* [Z G A](files/zga.md) - my "artistic" (if you can call it that) moniker. I do mostly electronic with no particular focus on subgenre, but I mostly do IDM (hate the term), industrial and/or hip-hop. I will soon be doing some releases, both solo and featuring colaborations (with DEL and SPASM). Follow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ZGAZGAZGA/) to be the first to know when they are released

# Follow me 

I am pretty much everywhere, but one of the best places to catch me is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zga_aaa).
